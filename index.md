# Visualizing Demographic Changes Near Bay Area Rail Stations

### Scope and Motivation

This project is focusing on understanding the impacts of rail stations on key demographic areas. The Bay Area consist of multiple transportation agencies within the nine Bay Area Counties. Within those counties, there are seven rail lines that serves the residents of the Bay Area. The rail lines that will be focused on are BART, MUNI, and SMART. 

Below is the graph of stations that are focused on in the project:

The time frame that was focused on is between 2010 and 2020. The census tracts around each respective station of focus was analyed for temporal changes, before and after the station was opened. The demographic area that was the main focus was Household Income. 

## Methodology

In order to investigate the impact of Bay Area Rail Stations, we collected data from Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC) Data and American Community Survey (ACS) Data from 2010 - 2020. The MTC dataset provided train station data while the ACS data provides average household income for each respective tract.

Packages that are ultilized in juypter notebook for the analysis are below:
