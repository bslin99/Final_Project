# Visualizing Demographic Changes Near Bay Area Rail Stations

### Scope and Motivation

This project is focusing on understanding the impacts of rail stations on key demographic areas. The Bay Area consist of multiple transportation agencies within the nine Bay Area Counties. Within those counties, there are seven rail lines that serves the residents of the Bay Area. The intended investigatation is whether rail transit stops are in denser areas, higher income areas, and/or areas of high white population concentration. The insipiration to answer this because of its equity applications, as rail is faster, reliable, and heavily subsidized compared to the bus.

The rail lines that will be focused on are BART, MUNI, and SMART. 

Below is the graph of stations that are focused on in the project:

The time frame that was focused on is between 2010 and 2020. The census tracts around each respective station of focus was analyed for temporal changes, before and after the station was opened. The two demographic areas of focus was Household Income and Race. 

## Methodology

In order to investigate the impact of Bay Area Rail Stations, we collected data from Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC) Data and American Community Survey (ACS) Data from 2010 - 2020. The MTC dataset provided train station data while the ACS data provides average household income for each respective tract.

Packages that are ultilized in juypter notebook for the analysis are below:

```markdown
import json      # library for working with JSON-formatted text strings
import requests  # library for accessing content from web URLs
import pprint    # library for cleanly printing Python data structures
pp = pprint.PrettyPrinter()
import pandas as pd
import earthpy as et
import geopandas as gpd
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
```

The analysis of census data with all 10 years. Each year from 2010-2020 had to individually be analyzed to determine total income and average income for each respective year. The census data provided the number of individuals making the between a range of annual incomes.

```markdown
census_2011_1 = census_2011.iloc[1:,[0,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20,22,24,26,28,30,32]]
census_2011_2 = census_2011_1.astype(int)

#Calculating total income
census_2011_2['B19001_002E'] = census_2011_2['B19001_002E']*5000
census_2011_2['B19001_003E'] = census_2011_2['B19001_003E']*12500

census_2011_2['B19001_010E'] = census_2011_2['B19001_010E']*47500
census_2011_2['B19001_011E'] = census_2011_2['B19001_011E']*55000
census_2011_2['B19001_012E'] = census_2011_2['B19001_012E']*67500
census_2011_2['B19001_013E'] = census_2011_2['B19001_013E']*87500
census_2011_2['B19001_014E'] = census_2011_2['B19001_014E']*112500
census_2011_2['B19001_015E'] = census_2011_2['B19001_015E']*137500
census_2011_2['B19001_016E'] = census_2011_2['B19001_016E']*175000
census_2011_2['B19001_017E'] = census_2011_2['B19001_017E']*250000

#Handling the NaN error that we couldnt solve
census_2011_2['TotalIncome'] = census_2011_2[1:].sum(axis=1)
census_2011_3 = census_2011_2
census_2011_3.iloc[0,-1] = census_2011_2.iloc[0,:].sum()

#Calculating average
census_2011_3['AverageIncome'] = census_2011_3['TotalIncome']/census_2011_3['B19001_001E']
census_2011_4 = census_2011_3

#Identification
census_2011_4['trctid'] = census_2011['GEO_ID'].str[9:] #Adding ID

census_2011_5 = census_2011_4[["trctid","AverageIncome"]] #print
census_2011_5
```

The same process is ultilized when analyzing the racial demographics from the census data was

## Results

In terms of output, the graphs below shows the percent change of Income within all Bay Area rail stations that were opened between 2010 and 2020.
